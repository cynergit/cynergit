## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.
Using Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across
**all platforms** which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows
on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
Want to try it before doing anything else?
Do it [with the online demo](https://try.gitea.io/)!
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io).
